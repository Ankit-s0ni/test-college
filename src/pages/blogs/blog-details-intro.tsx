                <strong>A PhD program</strong> is a long journey and a fulfilling adventure.{' '}
                <strong>The time it takes to get a PhD will differ</strong> based on where you are
                studying. <strong>In India, PhD programs typically take 3 to 5 years</strong>, which
                includes coursework, qualifying exams, and research. Your timing and completion vary
                if your research topics are complex, you are researching a long-term issue, or you
                are working while you are studying. Whereas, <strong>PhD programs abroad</strong>{' '}
                are another matter with great variation, so it will likely take longer. For example,
                sometimes when you <strong>study for a PhD in the US or Canada</strong>, this could
                take approximately <strong>5 to 7 years</strong> with more emphasis on research and
                dissertation work. Surprisingly, <strong>a PhD in many European countries</strong>{' '}
                can take a shorter time, depending on the country and what type of educational field
                you are in. In this blog, we will highlight{' '}
                <strong>what a PhD looks like in India and abroad</strong>, so you can plan out your
                academic journey. Letâ€™s take a closer look!
