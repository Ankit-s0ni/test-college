Continuous Assessment Test (CAT) covering 30% weightage. This test includes the different quizzes, assignments, mid-term tests, and case studies that the students attempt.

Final Assessment Test (FAT) covering 70% weightage. This test includes the computer-based proctored examination in an online mode or at an exam center.

All students who have registered for a particular course are eligible to write the CAT and FAT (Theory/Lab) of that course. However, the student is not allowed to give exams if they are caught in shortage of attendance or any acts of indiscipline.`,
